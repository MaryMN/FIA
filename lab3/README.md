## General info

Task for this lab. work was to create a program using linear regression
that could predict the price of an apartment given a set of characteristics of the apartment
complex


## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.7
* Colab Notebook
* Libraries:
    * Scikit-learn 
    * Pandas
    * Numpy
	
## Setup
The are 2 posibilities to run this project.
The first one is using online tool [Google Notebook Colab] (https://colab.research.google.com/). We need to upload the notebook file on your Google Drive (do not forget that having a Google Account is obligatory )))

The second one is to run local on your computer, and for this is required to instal the following libraries, just copy and paste these on your console.


If you haven't some imports, just install them, because on computer the code will not run, without adding this lines of codes:

```
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install Scikit

```

And for running the file, after installing the libs, just type in your console:


```
python try.py
```



### Launch

When you are in Google Colab, is needed to upload the file with data in section <Files>
  
  ![Example 1](https://github.com/MaryMN/FIA/blob/master/lab3/images/colab.png "Upload data file")
  
  After that just upload the Notebook file to your GoogleDrive and run it.
