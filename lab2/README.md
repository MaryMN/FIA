## General info

This laboratory work is about implementing the flocking behaviour to a mini project: "RiceRock" (Asteroids) by applying fundamental rules: Cohesion, Alignment, and Separation. Also is needed to implement two another behaviour.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.7
* CodeSkulptor
	
## Setup
Just download the file and run it with Simulation.py.

To run this project, just type on tour console 
```
python simulation.py
```

If you haven't some imports, just install them, because on computer the code will not run, without adding this lines of codes:

```
try:
    import simplegui
except ImportError:
    import SimpleGUICS2Pygame.simpleguics2pygame as simplegui

```
For installing, the module, use the following in your console.
```
pip install SimpleGUICS2Pygame --user
```


### Launch

When the environment is setted up write the game window with game will appear.

Also, you can run the code using [codeskulptor online tool](http://www.codeskulptor.org/)
